# EE267_LAB0: Access Carla

First steps will be to install Carla onto the system or to access Carla via
the web portal. We will go over the steps required for each. 

## 1. Accessing Carla via Web Portal ##
First step is to go UCR Library website and install the schools VPN. This allows for access
to the server while not being on the schools WiFi. 
[You can view the instructions here to install the VPN](https://library.ucr.edu/using-the-library/technology-equipment/connect-from-off-campus)

After the VPN is installed you will need to navigate to your Global Protect VPN in the icon
bar. It should look like this:

## 2. Installing Carla locally on Machine ##

This step is more difficult as it requires an manual install of Carla and hardware powerful enough to run
it.
